This problem represents a massive opportunity to address both environmental sustainability and student welfare simultaneously. Current cafeteria operations lack efficient systems to redistribute surplus food, creating a dual crisis of waste and hunger on campus.",

The mental health crisis among college students has reached unprecedented levels, yet traditional support systems remain inadequate. Students facing acute mental health challenges often go without timely intervention, leading to academic failure, withdrawal, and in severe cases, self-harm. The gap between demand and available resources continues to widen each semester.",

This unsustainable cost structure forces students to choose between buying required materials and meeting basic needs like food and housing. Many students resort to sharing books, using outdated editions, or going without, directly impacting their academic performance and future career prospects.",
